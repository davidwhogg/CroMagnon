## dependencies
- To start, we will work with data from the
[EMPIAR](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/).
- We will probably need to use
[EMAN2](http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2) to read the image data files.

## comments
- Why are we doing this?
- Can we apply this to astronomical data?
- Should we take [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryo-em)?
